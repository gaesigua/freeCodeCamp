                                                            STEP 40: There are many kinds of inputs you can create using the type attribute. you can create a password field, button, or a control to let users select a file from their computer; but for us, let's create a text field to get input from a user by adding the 'type', with the value 'text'
                                                            STEP 41: Let's add name attribute; the name attribute represents the data being submitted

                                                            STEP 47: Let's nest the radio button inside a label element; the label element  is used to help associate the text for an input element with the input element itself, especially for assistive technologies like screen readers
                                                            STEP 48: Let's add an id attribute with the value indoor to the radio button; id attributes are used to identify specific HTML elements; each id attribute's value must be unique from all the other id values for the entire page 
                                                            STEP 50: Notice that without the 'name' attribute, both radio buttons can be selected at the same time; let's add the name attribute with the value indoor - outdoor to both radio buttons 
                                                            STEP 51: Let's add a value attribute to both radio buttons; because if you select the Indoor radio button and submit the form, the form data for the button is based on its name and value attributes. Since my radio buttons do not have a value attribute, the form data will include indoor-outdoor=on, which is not useful when you have multiple buttons
                                                            STEP 52: Let's nest the Indoor and Outdoor radio buttons within a fieldset element; the fieldset element is used to group related inputs and labels together in a web form. fieldset elements are block-level elements, meaning that they appear on a new line -->
