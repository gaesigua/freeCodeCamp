<!--LEARN BASIC CSS BY BUILDING A CAFE MENU -->
<!--STEP 1: Let's add all the declaration -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <!--STEP 2: Let's add head element within the html element, and add a title element -->
    <title>Cafe Menu</title>
    <!--STEP 3: Inside the head element, let's nest a meta element with an attribute named charset, and set the value to utf-8 to tell the browser how to encode the characters for the page -->

    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
    <!--STEP 10: Up until now, you have been limited regarding the presentation and appearance of the content you create. To start taking control, add a style element within the head element. -->
    <!-- STEP 11: Let's center the content of the h1 element by setting its text-align property to the value center.
         STEP 12: Let's center the content of the h2 and the p elements by adding a new type selector for each one to the existing style element.-->
    <!--STEP 13: Let's delete the three existing type selectors and replace them with one selector list that centers the text for the h1, h2, and p elements. -->
    <!--STEP 14, 15: Let's create a CSS FILE, move the style element there. -->
    <!-- STEP 16: Now let's link the styles2.css file so the styles will be applied again. -->
     <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
     <!-- STEP 17: Let's add meta element with a special content attribute -->

</head>
<!--STEP 4: Let's add the body element to create some actual content-->
<body>
    <!-- STEP 20: Let's add a div element inside the body element and then move all the other elements inside the new div. Inside the opening div tag, add the id attribute with a value of menu. -->
    <!-- STEP 26: Change the existing ID into a class with the same value -->
    <div class="menu">
        <!--Step 5: It's time to add some menu content. Add a main element within the existing body element. It will eventually contain pricing information about coffee and desserts offered by the cafe.-->
    <main>
        <!--Step 6: The name of the cafe is CAMPER CAFE. Add an h1 element within your main element. Give it the name of the cafe in capitalized letters to make it stand out. -->
        <h1>CAMPER CAFE</h1>

        <!--Step 7: To let visitors know the cafe was founded in 2020, add a p element below the h1 element with the text Est. 2020 -->
        <!-- Step 61: Now apply the established class to the Est. 2020 text -->
        <!--Step 66: You can use an hr element to display a divider between sections of different content. First, add an hr element between the p element with the class established and the first section element.-->
        <p class="established">Est. 2020 </p>
        <!--Step 8: There will be two sections on the menu, one for coffees and one for desserts. Add a section element within the main element so you have a place to put all the coffees available. -->
        <hr>
        <section>
            <!--Step 9: Create an h2 element in the section element and give it the text Coffee. -->
            <h2>Coffee</h2>
            <!--Step 88: The menu looks good, but other than the coffee beans background image, it is mainly just text. Under the Coffee heading, add an image using the url https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/css-cafe/coffee.jpg. Give the image an alt value of coffee icon. -->
            <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/css-cafe/coffee.jpg" alt="coffee icon">
            <!--STEP 29: Step 29: Itâ€™s looking good. Time to start adding some menu items. Add an empty article element under the Coffee heading. It will contain a flavor and price of each coffee you currently offer. -->
            <!--STEP 36: Step 36: That is kind of what you want, but now it would be nice if the flavor and price were on the same line. p elements are block-level elements, so they take up the entire width of their parent element. To get them on the same line, you need to apply some styling to the p elements so they behave more like inline elements. To do that, start by adding a class attribute with the value item to the first article element under the Coffee heading. -->
            <article  class="item">
                <!--Step 30: 'article' elements commonly contain multiple elements that have related information. In this case, it will contain a coffee flavor and a price for that flavor. Nest two p elements inside your article element. The first one's text should be French Vanilla, and the second's text 3.00. -->
                <!--STEP 31: Step 31: Starting below the existing coffee/price pair, add the following coffee and prices using article elements with two nested p elements inside each. As before, the first p element's text should contain the coffee flavor and the second p element's text should contain the price. -->
                <!--Step 32: The flavors and prices are currently stacked on top of each other and centered with their respective p elements. It would be nice if the flavor was on the left and the price was on the right. Let's add the class name flavor to the French Vanilla p element. -->
                <!-- Step 34: Next, you want to align the price to the right. Add a class named price to your p element that has 3.00 as its text.-->
                <!-- Step 40: That worked, but there is still a little space on the right of the price. You could keep trying various percentages for the widths. Instead, use the back space key on your keyboard to move the p element with the class price next to the p element with the class flavor so that they are on the same line in the editor. Make sure there is no space between the two elements.-->
                <!--Step 42: Now that you know it works, you can change the remaining article and p elements to match the first set. Start by adding the class item to the other article elements -->
                <!--Step 43: Next, position the other p elements to be on the same line with no space between them.-->
                <!--Step 44: To complete the styling, add the applicable class names flavor and price to all the remaining p elements.-->
                <p class="flavor">French Vanilla</p><p class="price">3.00</p>
            </article>

        </section>
        <!-- STEP 46: You will come back to styling the menu in a few steps, but for now, go ahead and add a second section element below the first for displaying the desserts offered by the cafe.-->
         <!--STEP 47: Let's add an h2 element in the new section and give it the text Desserts. -->
         <!--STEP 48: Add an empty article element under the Desserts heading. Give it a class attribute with the value item. -->
         <!--STEP 49: Let's nest two p elements inside your article element. The first one's text should be Donut, and the second's text 1.50. Put both of them on the same line making sure there is no space between them.-->
         <!--Step 50: For the two p elements you just added, add dessert as the value of the first p element's class attribute and the value price as the second p element's class attribute. -->
         <!--Step 52: Below the dessert you just added, add the rest of the desserts and prices using three more article elements, each with two nested p elements. Each element should have the correct dessert and price text, and all of them should have the correct classes. -->
         <section>
            <h2>Desserts</h2>
            <!-- Step 90: Add one last image under the Desserts heading using the url https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/css-cafe/pie.jpg. Give the image an alt value of pie icon. -->
             <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/css-cafe/pie.jpg" alt="pie icon">

    <!-- Step 71: Go ahead and add another hr element between the main element and the footer element. -->
    <!-- Step 76: Now add the bottom-line class to the second hr element so the styling is applied. -->
    <hr class="bottom-line">
    <!--Step 63: Let's add a footer element below the main element, where you can add some additional information.-->
    <!--Step 64: Inside the footer, add a p element. Then, nest an anchor (a) element in the p that links to https://www.freecodecamp.org and has the text Visit our website. 
    Make sure that the link opens in a new tab by adding a target attribute with the value _blank.-->
    <!--Step 65: Add a second p element below the one with the link and give it the text 123 Free Code Camp Drive.-->
